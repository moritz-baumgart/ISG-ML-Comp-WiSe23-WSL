### RecBole

This folder contains my first experiments with recbole. I just trained a simple model using `bpr-general.yml` and `run.py`. Because recbole needs a special file format I generated that using `gen_inter.py` beforehand.

The code here is kind of redundant with the one in the main repo, this is because I did not realize that recbole also runs on windows. Please refer to the main repo.
